**What is happening**
----------------------

- freesurfer preprocessing done on sup servers (all results stored there)
- scrape the necessary information and add to textfiles using `fs_extract_stats.py`

- initial descriptions of the dataset in form of jupyter notebook `clinics_laod_desc.ipynb`
    - needs `clinics_desc)functions.py` as dependency
